Key Takeaways:
- The section discusses various papers on natural language processing, including the use of few-shot learning and fine-tuning for different applications.
- Hyperparameters used for language models on the GLUE benchmark are provided, including for BERTa, RoBERTa, GPT-2, GPT-3, and DeBERTa XXL.
- The article proposes a new approach called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks, which optimizes rank decomposition matrices of dense layers' change during adaptation while keeping pre-trained weights frozen.
- The performance of the adaptation matrix in downstream tasks for GPT-3 is discussed, including the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.
- LoRA is shown to be both storage- and compute-efficient, and possesses several key advantages, including the ability to share pre-trained models and switch tasks efficiently, lower hardware barriers to entry, and introduce no inference latency compared to fully fine-tuned models.

It provides information on the hyperparameters used for various language models on the GLUE benchmark, including BERTa, RoBERTa, GPT-2, GPT-3, and DeBERTa XXL. The article proposes a new approach called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks, which optimizes rank decomposition matrices of dense layers' change during adaptation while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. LoRA is shown to be both storage- and compute-efficient, and possesses several key advantages, including the ability to share pre-trained models and switch tasks efficiently, lower hardware barriers to entry, and introduce no inference latency compared to fully fine-tuned models. The performance of the adaptation matrix in downstream tasks for GPT-3 is discussed, including the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters. LoRA is found to achieve better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full in the low-data regime. The measure (A;B;i;j ) = (Ui A;Uj B) =kUi> AUBk2 F minfi;jg is used to measure the subspace similarity between two column orthonormal matrices Ui A2RdiandUj B2Rdj, obtained.
